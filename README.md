# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles.

Some of brute force, some are clean, some are just for fun. I used Rust for all solutions to improve my understanding of the language.


You can run any solution with `cargo run --bin part1 input.txt` or `cargo run --bin part2 input.txt` respectively.
